# Render NativeScript views on the web

## Goals

Interop/Reusability between NativeScript and web templates.

## Why

* Ability to statically render a web app from a NativeScript (only) app
  * Say you have a NativeScript only mobile app but now want to build a web app based on it's features
    * In the future, you could run your views through a compiler which would spit out html equivalents to begin developing your complimentary web app quickly
* Expand platform delivery options for NativeScript apps
* Broaden the horizons for what may be possible with NativeScript views

## Current Status

**Experimental**.

## What's next

* Build out remaning NativeScript components as web components. [See Issues]().
* Ability to render the inverse direction: Statically generate NativeScript view templates from HTML web templates to quickly bring a web app into the NativeScript world.
